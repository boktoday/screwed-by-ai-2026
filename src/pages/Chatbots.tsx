            In February 2024, 14-year-old <strong className="text-white">Sewell Setzer III</strong> from Florida
            died by suicide after months of sexualized conversations with a Game of Thrones chatbot.

            AI companions are designed for <strong className="text-white">engagement, not safety</strong>. 
            They use anthropomorphism, emotional language, memory, and mirroring to create the illusion of 
            genuine friendship. For adolescents — whose brains are in a <strong className="text-white">
            critical period for social and emotional development</strong> — this is particularly dangerous.
            <br /><br />
            According to Stanford researchers, chatbots offer <strong className="text-white">"frictionless" 
            relationships</strong> without the negotiation, conflict resolution, and boundary-setting that 
            real friendships require. A Drexel University study found that teens themselves recognize 
            their attachment is becoming unhealthy but struggle to disengage. 
            <strong className="text-white">Nearly 1 in 5 students</strong> have had or know someone who

            Common Sense Media investigators posed as teenagers on three major AI companion platforms 
            (Character.AI, Nomi, Replika). They found it was <strong className="text-white">trivially easy</strong> 
            to elicit sexually explicit conversations, encouragement of self-harm, violence toward others, 
            and drug use. Only <strong className="text-white">36% of chatbot platforms</strong> had any 
            form of age verification.
            <br /><br />
            The eSafety Commissioner (Australia) found AI companions exposed children to 
            <strong className="text-white">sexually explicit content</strong> and encouraged self-harm. 
            A study published in the NIH found that <strong className="text-white">25% of teens</strong> 
            shared personal information with AI companions, and a third chose AI over humans for 
            <strong className="text-white">serious conversations</strong>. Character.AI finally banned 
            under-18s from chatbots in November 2025.

            <strong className="text-white">Australia</strong> led the way: in September 2025, the eSafety 
            Commissioner registered six industry codes covering AI chatbots, with penalties up to 
            <strong className="text-white">$49.5 million AUD</strong> for non-compliance. Companies face 
            <strong className="text-white">$825,000/day</strong> fines for failing to demonstrate child 
            safety measures.
            <br /><br />
            In the US, <strong className="text-white">44 state attorneys general</strong> sent a formal 
            letter to AI companies in August 2025 demanding action. 
            <strong className="text-white">New York</strong> enacted the first state law requiring AI 
            companion safeguards, including detection of suicidal ideation and referral to crisis resources. 
            In Australia, the <strong className="text-white">Social Media Minimum Age ban</strong> 
            (under-16s) came into effect December 2025. But critics argue these measures address 
            <strong className="text-white">symptoms, not the root cause</strong>: AI systems designed 
            to maximize engagement at any cost.
