            In January 2024, a Hong Kong finance employee joined a video call with their "CFO" and colleagues. 
            Every single person on that call was a <strong className="text-white">deepfake</strong>. 
            The employee authorized <strong className="text-white">$25.6 million</strong> in transfers before the fraud was discovered.
            This was not a one-off. CEO fraud now targets <strong className="text-white">400+ companies per day</strong>. 
            US deepfake losses hit <strong className="text-white">$1.1 billion</strong> in 2025 — tripling from $360M the year before. 
            Deloitte projects AI fraud losses will reach <strong className="text-white">$40 billion annually by 2027</strong>.
            A Florida mother was scammed out of $15,000 by an AI voice clone of her "daughter" claiming to be in jail.

            Over <strong className="text-white">453 global political deepfake incidents</strong> were recorded in 2025 alone. 
            In Australia, it is currently <strong className="text-white">legal</strong> to use deepfakes in political advertising — 
            the Hawke government's 1984 ban on misleading ads was repealed after 8 months and never reinstated. 
            The NSW government introduced election deepfake bans in March 2026, while South Australia and numerous US states 
            have enacted their own laws. But <strong className="text-white">72% of Australian adults</strong> encountered online 
            misinformation in the first half of 2025 (ACMA), and with generative AI making deepfakes cheaper and more convincing 
            by the month, the gap between threat and regulation is widening.

            Perhaps the most insidious harm: deepfakes used to create <strong className="text-white">non-consensual intimate imagery</strong>. 
            Australia introduced federal laws in 2024 banning the sharing of sexually explicit deepfake material, 
            with penalties of up to <strong className="text-white">7 years imprisonment</strong>. 
            The first prosecution occurred in 2026 — a South Australian man charged with 8 counts of creating 
            sexual material without consent. Senator David Pocock's <strong className="text-white">"My Face, My Rights" Bill</strong> 
            (Nov 2025) seeks to establish explicit rights over use of your face and voice. 
            But enforcement remains a drop in the ocean compared to the volume of material being created daily.

            Here's the uncomfortable truth: <strong className="text-white">we can't reliably detect deepfakes</strong>. 
            Australia's own CSIRO tested 16 leading deepfake detectors and found <strong className="text-white">none</strong> 
            could reliably identify real-world deepfakes. Human detection is even worse — a 2025 iProov study found 
            only <strong className="text-white">0.1% of people</strong> could accurately identify all deepfakes they were shown. 
            Commercial AI detectors achieve ~78% accuracy on in-the-wild content. The IRONSCALES 2025 Threat Report found 
            that 99% of security leaders expressed confidence in their defenses, but the average simulated detection score 
            was only <strong className="text-white">44%</strong>. The technology is advancing faster than our ability to detect it.
