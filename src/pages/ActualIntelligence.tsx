            Gartner estimated global AI spending would reach <strong className="text-white">$1.5 trillion</strong> 
            in 2025. But the MIT GenAI Divide Report, based on 150 executive interviews, a 350-employee survey, 
            and analysis of 300 public AI deployments, found that roughly 
            <strong className="text-white">95% of generative AI pilots delivered zero measurable financial return</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            The IBM Institute for Business Value found enterprise-wide AI initiatives achieved an average ROI of 
            <strong className="text-white">5.9%</strong> — despite incurring a 10%+ capital investment. 
            That's <strong className="text-white">negative net return</strong>. 
            S&P Global found 42% of companies <strong className="text-white">abandoned most AI initiatives in 2025</strong>, 
            up from 17% in 2024 — a <strong className="text-white">147% increase in abandonment</strong> in a single year. 
            The honeymoon is over and the hangover has begun.

            This is the central problem of the AI industry: 
            <strong className="text-white">impressive demos that never become working products</strong>. 
            Gartner predicted 30% of generative AI projects would be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025. 
            The reality appears worse. S&P Global found the average organization 
            <strong className="text-white">scrapped 46% of AI proofs-of-concept</strong> before they ever reached production.
            <br /><br />
            Only <strong className="text-white">48% of AI projects make it into production at all</strong>, 
            and those that do require an average of <strong className="text-white">8 months</strong> from prototype to production 
            (Gartner). RAND Corporation found over <strong className="text-white">80% of AI projects fail</strong> to reach 
            production deployment entirely. The failed projects aren't cheap either — each canceled POC typically costs 
            <strong className="text-white">$5-10 million</strong> before the plug is pulled.

            AI models ace standardized benchmarks while failing in the real world. This is the 
            <strong className="text-white">"streetlight effect"</strong> — measuring what's easy to measure 
            rather than what matters. Models that achieve 99% on benchmark datasets routinely make 
            <strong className="text-white">obvious errors in production</strong> that any human would catch.
            <br /><br />
            A McKinsey partner described the phenomenon: "A client's AI was brilliant at detecting fraudulent 
            transactions in the training data. In production, it flagged the CEO's legitimate travel as fraud 
            and missed an actual $2M theft. The gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability 
            is the industry's <strong className="text-white">dirty secret</strong>."
            <br /><br />
            MIT's report documented a mid-market manufacturing COO saying: 
            <strong className="text-white">"The hype on LinkedIn says everything has changed, but in our operations, 
            nothing fundamental has shifted. We're processing some contracts faster, but that's all."</strong>

            This isn't just a tech industry problem. The AI hype cycle has real-world consequences:
            <br /><br />
            <strong className="text-white">Misallocated capital</strong>: $1.5T spent on AI in 2025 is $1.5T not spent 
            on other productivity-enhancing investments. <strong className="text-white">Distorted markets</strong>: 
            AI company valuations disconnected from revenue create a bubble that will eventually burst. 
            <strong className="text-white">False promises</strong>: Companies are laying off workers based on projected 
            AI efficiencies that haven't materialized.
            <br /><br />
            <strong className="text-white">Regulatory whiplash</strong>: Policymakers rush to regulate worst-case AI 
            scenarios while ignoring the more mundane but real harms. 
            <strong className="text-white">Public trust erosion</strong>: Every overhyped AI launch and subsequent 
            failure makes it harder to have a rational conversation about what AI can actually do.
            <br /><br />
            The real danger isn't that AI is too powerful — it's that we're making decisions based on 
            <strong className="text-white">what we wish AI could do</strong>, not what it actually can do. 
            Actual intelligence would mean being honest about that gap.
