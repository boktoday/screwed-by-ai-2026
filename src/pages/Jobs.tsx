            Previous automation waves targeted <strong className="text-white">blue-collar</strong> work — 
            factory floors, assembly lines, repetitive physical tasks. This wave targets 
            <strong className="text-white"> cognitive labour</strong>. Goldman Sachs estimates 
            <strong className="text-white"> 300 million full-time jobs</strong> globally are exposed to 
            generative AI automation. McKinsey raised their estimate from 30% to 
            <strong className="text-white"> 40% of working hours automatable</strong> — the 
            timeline accelerated by AI. The IMF found ~60% of jobs in advanced economies are exposed.
            <br /><br />
            What's different: AI now affects <strong className="text-white">analysis, summarisation, 
            communication, and decision-support</strong> — the very tasks that defined white-collar 
            professional work. Administrative roles face 46% exposure, legal 44%, architecture and 
            engineering 37%. Construction: under 6%. The nature of work is being redefined at every level.

            The data is stark. A Stanford University pre-print found that 
            <strong className="text-white"> early-career workers (ages 22-25)</strong> in the most 
            AI-exposed occupations experienced a <strong className="text-white">16% relative decline in employment</strong> 
            since ChatGPT launched in late 2022. Goldman Sachs Research confirms that 
            unemployment among 20-30 year-olds in tech-exposed occupations has risen by almost 
            <strong className="text-white">3 percentage points</strong> since the start of 2025.
            <br /><br />
            This corroborates widespread reports that entry-level hiring in knowledge sectors 
            has <strong className="text-white">collapsed</strong>. Companies that used to hire junior 
            writers, coders, and analysts are instead using AI tools and expecting more from fewer, 
            more senior staff. The career ladder's bottom rungs are being removed.

            Workers with AI skills now command a <strong className="text-white">56% wage premium</strong> 
            over peers in identical roles without those skills — up from 25% the previous year, 
            <strong className="text-white">more than doubling in 12 months</strong> (PwC 2025).
            <br /><br />
            This creates a two-speed labour market. Those who can leverage AI are seeing their 
            value skyrocket. Those who can't — or whose entire role is automatable — face stagnant 
            wages, reduced hours, or outright displacement. 
            <strong className="text-white">37% of business leaders</strong> anticipate replacing workers 
            with AI by the end of 2026 (HRDive). Already, <strong className="text-white">13.7% of US workers</strong> 
            report losing a job to AI or automation (National University).
            <br /><br />
            The Dallas Federal Reserve found AI is simultaneously 
            <strong className="text-white">aiding and replacing workers</strong> — raising wages for some 
            while suppressing them for others, creating unprecedented labour market bifurcation.

            CSIRO research tells a nuanced story. Their study of 4,000+ Australian firms found that 
            <strong className="text-white">AI-adopting companies actually hire more</strong>, not fewer, 
            workers. But the skills demanded are rapidly evolving. 
            <strong className="text-white">68% of Australian businesses</strong> have adopted some form of AI 
            (CSIRO), while approximately <strong className="text-white">37% of SMEs</strong> specifically use AI tools (National AI Centre).
            <br /><br />
            The Australian Parliament's Inquiry into the Digital Transformation of Workplaces (2025) 
            recommended government-led campaigns on AI awareness, training, and upskilling. 
            CSIRO estimates Australia needs <strong className="text-white">161,000 new AI-savvy workers by 2030</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            But there's a warning too. The OECD found that while AI adoption in SMEs helps compensate 
            for labour shortages, it also risks <strong className="text-white">wage polarisation</strong> — 
            exactly the pattern playing out globally. And paradoxically, CSIRO itself cut ~100 AI research 
            roles in 2025, highlighting that <strong className="text-white">no sector is immune</strong> from 
            AI-driven restructuring.
