            When Instagram switched from a chronological feed to an algorithmic one in 2016, 
            it seemed like a convenience. But a 2026 CESifo working paper using Dutch LISS panel data 
            revealed something darker: the introduction of Instagram's algorithmic feed 
            <strong className="text-white"> had a measurable negative impact on teen mental health</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            Today, <strong className="text-white">75% of what you see on any major platform</strong> is 
            chosen by algorithm, not by your conscious choice. These algorithms optimize for a single metric: 
            <strong className="text-white">engagement</strong>. Not accuracy, not diversity, not your wellbeing. 
            Engagement. And the most engaging content is reliably the most 
            <strong className="text-white">emotional, extreme, and polarizing</strong>. 
            Emotionally negative content gets <strong className="text-white">3x more engagement</strong> than neutral 
            content (CESifo 2026). You're not scrolling. You're being manipulated.

            A 2025 systematic review by Ahmmad et al. in Societies Journal confirmed what many suspected: 
            social media algorithms <strong className="text-white">consistently reinforce ideological homogeneity</strong>, 
            limit viewpoint diversity, and intensify polarization among young users. 
            The algorithm shows you more of what you've already engaged with, creating a 
            <strong className="text-white">self-reinforcing cycle</strong> of narrowing perspectives.
            <br /><br />
            This isn't accidental. The PMC study "Normalizing Toxicity" (2025) found that algorithmic processes 
            create <strong className="text-white">"u-loops"</strong> — feedback cycles where users who engage with 
            extreme content are fed progressively more extreme versions. 
            A Georgia Tech study (Feb 2026), funded by a <strong className="text-white">$1.7 million grant</strong>, 
            is now auditing TikTok's recommendation algorithm specifically because of concerns about 
            its impact on <strong className="text-white">10,000+ adolescents</strong>. 
            The algorithm doesn't just reflect your interests. It shapes them.

            The mechanism is well-documented. Algorithms boost emotionally charged — especially 
            <strong className="text-white">negative or sensational</strong> — content because it drives the 
            highest engagement. This creates <strong className="text-white">"doomscrolling"</strong>: 
            compulsive consumption of bad news that worsens anxiety and depression (ACP 2025).
            <br /><br />
            A TPM journal study of 250 respondents across age groups found young participants reported 
            the <strong className="text-white">highest levels of anxiety and dependence on external validation</strong> 
            from algorithmic content. Engagement-based ranking reinforces 
            <strong className="text-white">anxiety, depression, and body image distress</strong>. 
            Exposure to self-harm and diet content is algorithmically linked to 
            <strong className="text-white">eating disorders and suicidal ideation</strong> (Bodewell Law 2025).
            The average teen spends <strong className="text-white">5.2 hours per day</strong> on algorithmically 
            curated content. That's 5.2 hours of their brain being optimized for someone else's profit.

            A scoping review published in PMC (2025) found that <strong className="text-white">23% of policy reports</strong> 
            recommended algorithmic transparency as a priority. The algorithms operate 
            <strong className="text-white">"opaquely, with little transparency"</strong> — users have 
            no idea why they're seeing what they're seeing.
            <br /><br />
            Calls for <strong className="text-white">algorithmic transparency</strong> — requiring platforms 
            to explain how and why content is prioritized — have been made by 
            <strong className="text-white">70+ policy reports, non-profits, and research institutions</strong> 
            worldwide. The EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) requires large platforms to provide algorithmic 
            transparency. Australia's eSafety Commissioner has recommended similar measures. The US has 
            no equivalent federal law. In the absence of regulation, the algorithms continue optimizing for 
            engagement at the expense of mental health — and we're left to wonder what they're doing to us.
