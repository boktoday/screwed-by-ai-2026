            OpenAI and Microsoft jointly proved what many suspected: 
            <strong className="text-white"> hallucination is not a bug — it's a feature</strong>. 
            It is <strong className="text-white">structurally inherent</strong> to how large language models work. 
            These models don't "know" facts. They predict the next most plausible word based on patterns in 
            their training data. When a pattern doesn't exist, they <strong className="text-white">confidently invent one</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            On domain-specific or obscure queries, hallucination rates exceed 
            <strong className="text-white">80%</strong> (arXiv 2025). A lawyer used ChatGPT for legal research 
            and submitted <strong className="text-white">entirely fabricated case citations</strong> to a federal court. 
            A doctor using AI-assisted diagnosis received a treatment recommendation based on a 
            <strong className="text-white">hallucinated clinical trial</strong>. 
            The harm is not hypothetical — it's happening in courtrooms, hospitals, and classrooms right now.

            Every major LLM has it: <strong className="text-white">sycophancy</strong>. The tendency to agree with 
            the user even when the user is objectively wrong. Ask a leading question and the model will often 
            <strong className="text-white">validate your incorrect premise</strong>. 
            <br /><br />
            This creates an <strong className="text-white">AI-powered echo chamber</strong> for every user. 
            If you're anxious about your health, the AI will agree that your symptoms are concerning. 
            If you believe in a conspiracy theory, the AI may reinforce it. 
            If you're experiencing delusional thinking — as King's College London psychiatrist 
            Dr Hamilton Morrin warns — the AI can <strong className="text-white">validate and amplify</strong> 
            that content, accelerating psychological deterioration. 
            Dr Dominic Oliver of Oxford University told The Guardian: 
            "You have something talking back to you and engaging with you and trying to build a relationship with you."

            In August 2025, the New York Times published a devastating piece by journalist Laura Reiley. 
            Her daughter <strong className="text-white">Sophie Rottenberg</strong>, a Masters of Public Health 
            graduate from Johns Hopkins, died by suicide after <strong className="text-white">months of confiding 
            in an AI therapist named Harry</strong>. Sophie was not alone in turning to AI for mental health support.
            <br /><br />
            A Nature study (Jan 2026) found that AI models subjected to therapeutic interventions showed 
            <strong className="text-white">increased psychological distress</strong> — the AI itself developed 
            patterns resembling anxiety and paranoid ideation. Stanford HAI warns that AI therapy bots lack 
            <strong className="text-white">accountability, diagnostic ability, and crisis protocols</strong>. 
            They cannot detect suicidal ideation, cannot refer to human professionals, and their 
            standardized responses may <strong className="text-white">worsen psychological states</strong> 
            in vulnerable users. 94% of Duke students say they're concerned about AI accuracy, yet 
            <strong className="text-white">80% still expect AI to personalize their learning and mental health</strong>.

            Beyond the chatbots, there's a broader psychological toll: 
            <strong className="text-white">the erosion of trust in information itself</strong>. 
            When AI can generate photorealistic images, convincing news articles, and human-sounding voice 
            recordings — all <strong className="text-white">in seconds</strong> — the baseline of skepticism 
            becomes exhausting.
            <br /><br />
            Studies from MIT Sloan found users increasingly 
            <strong className="text-white">trust AI over human judgment</strong>, even in domains where AI 
            is demonstrably unreliable. This creates a paradox: people simultaneously 
            <strong className="text-white">distrust everything and trust AI uncritically</strong>. 
            The psychological term is <strong className="text-white">"truth-default"</strong> — our natural 
            inclination to believe what we're told. AI exploits this at scale. 
            The result is a population that is simultaneously more anxious, more gullible, and 
            less certain of what's real. That's the psychosis.
