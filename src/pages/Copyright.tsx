            The LAION-5B dataset contains <strong className="text-white">5.85 billion image-text pairs</strong> 
            scraped from the internet. It's the training backbone of Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and most 
            image-generation models. The dataset includes copyrighted artwork, photographs, and illustrations — 
            used <strong className="text-white">without consent, credit, or compensation</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            In June 2025, a US District Judge ruled that <strong className="text-white">Anthropic's use of 
            pirated copies</strong> of over 250,000 books (obtained from a dataset called The Pile) for AI 
            training was <strong className="text-white">not fair use</strong>. This was a landmark ruling. 
            But paradoxically, the same judge ruled that <strong className="text-white">lawfully acquired books</strong> 
            used for the same purpose <strong className="text-white">were</strong> fair use. And another judge 
            in the same district ruled the exact opposite for Meta. 
            The law is <strong className="text-white">completely unsettled</strong>.

            The <strong className="text-white">New York Times</strong> sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December 2023, 
            alleging that millions of its articles were used to train ChatGPT — which now 
            <strong className="text-white">competes directly with the Times</strong> as a source of information. 
            The suit seeks <strong className="text-white">billions of dollars in damages</strong> and demands that 
            OpenAI destroy any chatbot models and training data using NYT content.
            <br /><br />
            The central question: <strong className="text-white">Is AI training on copyrighted works "fair use"?</strong> 
            Google Books was ruled fair use because it didn't substitute for the originals. But AI training 
            is different — these models create competing products. If the NYT wins, it will force 
            <strong className="text-white">mandatory licensing</strong> for all training data. If OpenAI wins, 
            fair use covers AI training and the creative industry shifts to 
            <strong className="text-white">legislative strategy</strong>. Either way, the 
            <strong className="text-white">outcome is expected by early 2027</strong>.

            The <strong className="text-white">Andersen v. Stability AI</strong> case is the first AI copyright 
            case to go to a <strong className="text-white">jury trial</strong>, scheduled for Q3 2026. 
            Plaintiffs Sarah Andersen (comic artist), Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz are seeking 
            <strong className="text-white">class certification covering an estimated 4 billion images</strong> 
            scraped from the web. If they win class certification, the settlement pressure on Stability AI 
            and any lab that trained on LAION-5B will be <strong className="text-white">enormous</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            In the UK, Getty Images sued Stability AI and won a partial victory in November 2025: the court 
            found that while the AI model weights themselves weren't "infringing copies," 
            <strong className="text-white">Stable Diffusion did reproduce Getty's watermarks</strong> in 
            outputs, constituting trademark infringement. Getty was granted leave to appeal the copyright 
            finding. <strong className="text-white">Disney and Universal</strong> have also entered the fray, 
            suing Midjourney for generating unlicensed likenesses of their copyrighted characters. 
            Hollywood is now watching.

            The legal landscape is a mess of <strong className="text-white">contradictory rulings</strong>:
            <br /><br />
            <strong className="text-white">Germany (Nov 2025)</strong>: GEMA v. OpenAI — court ruled AI training 
            on song lyrics infringed copyright. EU diverging from US.<br /><br />
            <strong className="text-white">UK (Nov 2025)</strong>: Getty v. Stability AI — model weights not 
            "copies" under UK law, but trademark infringement found. Appeal granted Dec 2025.<br /><br />
            <strong className="text-white">US (Jun 2025)</strong>: Anthropic ruling — pirated books not fair use; 
            lawfully acquired books were. Meta ruling in same district — opposite conclusion.<br /><br />
            <strong className="text-white">Australia</strong>: Copyright law under review by the Australian 
            Law Reform Commission. No AI-specific copyright legislation passed yet.
            <br /><br />
            Meanwhile, <strong className="text-white">50+ active lawsuits</strong> are pending globally. 
            Some companies (Axel Springer, AP, News Corp) have chosen to 
            <strong className="text-white">license their content</strong> rather than sue. But most creators 
            don't have that option. The fundamental question — <strong className="text-white">who owns the 
            right to train on your work?</strong> — remains unanswered.
